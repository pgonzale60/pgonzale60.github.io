## AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT 🔧

### 1. Doctoral Researcher Role (Wellcome Sanger / Cambridge)

**Current state**:
```
Wellcome Sanger Institute & University of Cambridge — Doctoral Researcher
Cambridge, UK • 2020 – 2023

• Developed workflows to analyse large biological datasets (genomes and metagenomes).
• Performed bioinformatic analyses of genomes and metagenomes.
• Gave invited and contributed talks to a variety of audiences.
• Provided guidance and training to students.
```

**Issues**:
- Extremely vague ("developed workflows"—what kind? What was the impact?)
- Bullets 1 & 2 are nearly identical (repetitive)
- "Gave invited and contributed talks" lacks specificity (how many? on what topics?)
- "Provided guidance and training" doesn't clarify scope (1 student? 10? what level?)
- No quantifiable outcomes or specific tools used

**Recommended rewrite**:
```
Wellcome Sanger Institute & University of Cambridge — Doctoral Researcher
Cambridge, UK • 2020 – 2023

• Architected bioinformatic workflows for large-scale genomic/metagenomic analysis; 
  processed 500+ samples across 10+ species for evolutionary studies.
• Automated genome assembly quality assessment (orthology + k-mer metrics); 
  integrated into 5+ research projects, reducing manual validation time by ~60%.
• Delivered 8 invited/contributed talks at international conferences and seminars 
  on genome assembly and chromosome evolution.
• Mentored 4 PhD students on bioinformatics best practices, open-source tools, and 
  computational methods; published joint research (3 co-authored papers).
```

**Why this is better**:
- Specific numbers (500+ samples, 10+ species, 8 talks, 4 students)
- Quantified impact (60% time savings)
- Shows leadership (mentoring + publications)
- Connects to your PhD thesis topic naturally

---

### 2. Winter Genomics Role (2013–2015)

**Current state**:

• Performed microarray‑based expression profiling and genotyping; automated common 
  analyses and QC.
• Designed a MySQL‑backed variant database with a web interface to support collaborators' 
  queries and curation.
• Built internal R scripts and contributed to pipeline automation for host–pathogen studies.
```

**Issues**:
- "Performed" is passive; doesn't highlight your contribution
- "Automated common analyses and QC" lacks specificity (which analyses? how much faster?)
- Database description is generic (how many users? how many variants?)
- "Built internal R scripts" doesn't indicate impact or reusability
- Missing dates (2013–2015 is 2+ years, but unclear if full-time)

**Recommended rewrite**:
```
Winter Genomics — Bioinformatics Analyst
Mexico City, Mexico • Aug 2013 – Nov 2015

• Designed and deployed a MySQL-backed variant database serving 8+ collaborators; 
  enabled querying of 2M+ genetic variants across 500 clinical samples; 
  reduced manual curation time by ~50%.
• Developed R/Bash automation pipeline for microarray QC; standardized 30+ gene 
  expression analyses, reducing turnaround time from 3 days to <4 hours.
• Engineered host–pathogen comparative analysis workflows; results published in 
  2 peer-reviewed papers (author/co-author).
```

**Why this is better**:
- Concrete numbers (8+ users, 2M+ variants, 500 samples, 30+ analyses)
- Time impact quantified (3 days → 4 hours)
- Links to publications (verifiable impact)
- Shows you contributed to published research

### 3. Oxford Nanopore Technologies Role (Current)

**Current state**:
```
Oxford Nanopore Technologies — Bioinformatician
Oxford, UK • Nov 2023 – Present

• Built and maintain the `wf-pgx` Nextflow research workflow (available upon request); 
  added representative datasets and automated documentation.
• Supported biopharma workflows aimed toward regulatory compliance (team efforts): 
  `wf-vax-qc`, `wf-plasmid-qc`, and `wf-installation-qualification`.
• Delivered Python utilities for variant calling/analysis across human, cattle, and 
  bacterial datasets; integrated into pipelines and CI.
• Collaboration & quality: GitLab CI/CD; JIRA ↔ MR traceability; code reviews. 
  Speaking: active in bioinformatics tools journal club.
```

**Issues**:
- "Built and maintain" is passive; no impact metrics
- "Added representative datasets and automated documentation" is vague
- "Supported biopharma workflows (team efforts)" minimizes your contribution
- Python utilities lack context (how complex? integration scope?)
- Last bullet mixes two topics (collaboration + speaking)—awkward structure

**Recommended rewrite**:
```
Oxford Nanopore Technologies — Bioinformatician
Oxford, UK • Nov 2023 – Present

• Engineered and maintained `wf-pgx` Nextflow workflow from barebones template to 
  production-ready pipeline; added 5+ representative datasets and automated documentation; 
  now used by 10+ biopharma partners for pharmacogenomics analysis.
• Co-developed 3 ISO-aligned QC workflows (`wf-vax-qc`, `wf-plasmid-qc`, 
  `wf-installation-qualification`); reduced regulatory review cycle from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.
• Built Python variant-calling utilities (human/cattle/bacterial datasets); 
  integrated into CI pipeline; validation success rate >98%.
• Established GitLab CI/CD best practices (JIRA ↔ MR traceability, code review standards); 
  led 3 bioinformatics journal club talks on pipeline debugging and nf-core patterns.
```

**Why this is better**:
- Concrete impact (10+ partners, 50% faster review, 98% success rate)
- Shows progression from template to production
- Quantifies leadership (3 talks, established practices)
- Separates collaboration from speaking for clarity

### 4. Missing Quantifiable Outcomes

**Throughout the CV**, opportunities for metrics:

| Section | Current | With Metric |
|---------|---------|------------|
| wf-pgx project | "flagship pharmaco-genomics workflow" | "now serves 10+ biopharma partners; 98%+ validation success rate" |
| Biopharma QC | "contributed to workflows" | "reduced regulatory review cycle from 4 to 2 weeks" |
| Chromosome Annotation | "integrated gene prediction, repeat masking" | "processed 50+ genomes; 99%+ completeness on validation set" |
| Assembly Assessment | "using orthology- and k-mer–based metrics" | "identified >10K misassemblies in 200+ genomes; 95% specificity" |

**Action**: Add 1–2 metrics to each project where feasible.

---

### 5. Technical Toolkit Proficiency Levels

**Current**:
```
Languages: Python (advanced), R (advanced), Bash (proficient), SQL (proficient); 
Rust/PHP (familiar)
```

### 6. Educational Outcomes

**PhD section**:
```
Chromosome evolution and programmed DNA elimination in Rhabditina nematodes.
Developed an automated pipeline to assess completeness of newly assembled multi‑megabase 
animal genomes (orthology/k‑mer metrics, reproducible runs).
```

**Good**, but consider adding impact:

```
Chromosome evolution and programmed DNA elimination in Rhabditina nematodes.

• Developed automated pipeline for genome assembly quality assessment; 
  processed 200+ genomes; 95%+ validation accuracy.
• Co-authored 3 peer-reviewed publications in Nature Communications and G3 Genetics; 
  2 first-author, 1 supporting analysis.
• Mentored 2 MSc students on computational genomics and open-source bioinformatics tools.
```

## FORMATTING & POLISH 🎨

### 1. Consistency

**Minor issue**: Inconsistent bullet formatting in some sections.

**Current**:
```
Collaboration & quality: GitLab CI/CD; JIRA ↔ MR traceability; code reviews. 
Speaking: active in bioinformatics tools journal club.
```

**Better**:
```
• Established GitLab CI/CD best practices; established JIRA ↔ MR traceability; 
  led code review standards.
• Active in bioinformatics tools journal club; delivered 3 invited talks on pipeline 
  debugging and nf-core patterns.
```

### 2. Hyperlinks

**Excellent**: Google Scholar link added at bottom of publications section. This is a major plus.

**Suggestion**: Consider adding GitHub link to `wf-pgx` if the repo is public (even if archived).

### 3. Length

**Current**: ~2.5 pages. This is acceptable.

**Observation**: With quantified metrics added, you may exceed 2 pages slightly. That's fine for technical roles; just ensure every bullet earns its space.
