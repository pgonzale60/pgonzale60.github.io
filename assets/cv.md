## Professional Summary
Bioinformatics workflow engineer with 8+ years building reproducible genomic analysis pipelines. Strong in Nextflow, containerisation, and CI/CD; maintainer of `wf-pgx` (research‑use only).

I turn research into robust systems with Python and R, and an automation‑first mindset (from GNU Make to modern CI). I prototype LLM‑assisted workflows to streamline text‑heavy tasks when useful, while following quality practices aligned with ISO‑style accreditation goals.

## Core Competencies
- **Workflow Engineering**: Nextflow DSL2, nf-core patterns, schema‑driven parameters, clear I/O contracts.
- **Containerisation & Builds**: Docker/OCI, Singularity/Apptainer; reproducible environments.
- **Software Collaboration**: Git workflows, code review, design documentation, changelog management.
- **CI/CD & Verification**: GitHub Actions/Jenkins, smoke tests, automated documentation (`parse_docs`).
- **HPC & Cloud**: Slurm; working familiarity with AWS (S3, EC2 basics).
- **Data Handling**: Python (pandas, NumPy), R (tidyverse, Shiny), Bash; Rust/PHP (basic familiarity).
- **Reporting**: Coverage metrics (mosdepth), VCF stats, HTML report generation.

## Professional Experience

### Oxford Nanopore Technologies — Bioinformatician  
*Oxford, UK • Nov 2023 – Present*
- Built and maintained Nextflow pipelines for targeted sequencing (schema‑driven parameters, containerised modules, CI smoke tests).
- Maintained and evolved `epi2me-labs/wf-pgx` (research‑use only) with representative datasets and automated documentation.
- Delivered Python utilities for variant calling/analysis across human, cattle, and bacterial datasets; integrated into pipelines and CI.
- Consolidated PharmCAT/Chinook artefacts into a unified `star_alleles.tsv`, preserving raw JSON for traceability.
- Improved documentation quality and consistency via `parse_docs`, schema/output definitions, and templated READMEs.
- Speaking & engagement: active in bioinformatics tools journal club (3 sessions/year).

### Winter Genomics — Bioinformatics Intern  
*Mexico City, Mexico • Aug 2013 – Nov 2015*
- Performed microarray‑based expression profiling and genotyping; automated common analyses and QC.
- Designed a MySQL‑backed variant database with a web interface to support collaborators’ queries and curation.
- Built internal R scripts and contributed to pipeline automation for host–pathogen studies.

### Independent Bioinformatics Consultant  
*Remote • 2019 – 2022*
- Migrated academic genomics scripts to reproducible Nextflow pipelines; delivered Singularity/Apptainer‑enabled HPC deployments.
- Rolled out Git‑based collaboration workflows (branching, reviews, CI smoke tests) to improve team velocity and code quality.

## Selected Projects
- **wf-pgx Evolution (ONT)**: Designed and now maintain flagship pharmaco-genomics workflow; added automated container builds, regression suites, and robust documentation pipeline.
- **Verification Workflow Suite**: Reusable Nextflow modules for coverage reporting, variant metrics, and report diffs to validate releases across datasets.
- **Chromosome-scale Genome Annotation (MSc)**: Nextflow workflow to annotate multi‑megabase animal genomes; integrated gene prediction, repeat masking, and evidence-driven refinement for mid-scale HPC.
- **Assembly Completeness Assessment (PhD)**: Automated pipeline to assess completeness of newly assembled multi‑megabase animal genomes using orthology- and k‑mer–based metrics.
- **GEO Differential Expression Automation (BSc thesis)**: Automated microarray-based differential expression across dozens of GEO experiments using GNU Make; downloaded datasets and Brainarray annotations, inferred experimental designs, executed group-vs-group contrasts, and summarised results in a single table.
- **Regulatory Gene Visualisation (BSc training)**: Automated gene visualisation for a gene regulation website using PHP and available regulatory annotations.
- **AI-assisted Preference Matching (personal R&D)**: Prototyped LLM‑assisted workflows to match user preferences against free‑text (e.g., adverts) to reduce manual screening.

Context and outcomes (selected):
- wf‑pgx: improved clarity via schema‑driven params and docs automation; easier review for research users.
- Verification Suite: standardised release checks and metrics diffs; faster validation cycles.
- AI matching: accelerated manual screening tasks using LLM‑assisted triage and ranking prototypes.
