## Professional Summary
Bioinformatics workflow engineer with 8+ years building reproducible genomic analysis pipelines. Proficient in Nextflow (DSL2) with a focus on debugging, module composition, and automation. Experienced with containerisation and GitLab CI/CD in ISO‑aligned quality settings. Built the `wf-pgx` research workflow from a template to a usable pipeline (available upon request).

I use Nextflow as the backbone of bioinformatics automation, supported by Python and R for analysis and glue. I also prototype LLM‑assisted helpers to streamline text‑heavy tasks when appropriate.

## Core Competencies
- **Nextflow Automation**: DSL2, nf‑core patterns, schema‑driven parameters, channel design, and debugging.
- **Reproducible Environments**: Docker/OCI, Singularity/Apptainer.
- **Collaboration & Traceability**: GitLab merge requests, code review, changelog management; JIRA ticketing linked to MRs.
- **CI/CD & Verification**: GitLab CI/CD, smoke tests, automated documentation.
- **HPC & Cloud**: Slurm; working familiarity with AWS (S3, EC2 basics).
- **Analysis & Glue**: Python (pandas, NumPy), R (tidyverse, Shiny), Bash; Rust/PHP (familiar).
- **Reporting**: Coverage metrics (mosdepth), VCF stats, HTML report generation.

## Professional Experience

### Oxford Nanopore Technologies — Bioinformatician  
*Oxford, UK • Nov 2023 – Present*
- Built and maintain the `wf-pgx` Nextflow research workflow (available upon request); added representative datasets and automated documentation.
- Supported biopharma workflows aimed toward regulatory compliance (team efforts): `wf-vax-qc`, `wf-plasmid-qc`, and `wf-installation-qualification`.
- Delivered Python utilities for variant calling/analysis across human, cattle, and bacterial datasets; integrated into pipelines and CI.
- Collaboration & quality: GitLab CI/CD; JIRA ↔ MR traceability; code reviews. Speaking: active in bioinformatics tools journal club.

### Winter Genomics — Bioinformatics Intern  
*Mexico City, Mexico • Aug 2013 – Nov 2015*
- Performed microarray‑based expression profiling and genotyping; automated common analyses and QC.
- Designed a MySQL‑backed variant database with a web interface to support collaborators’ queries and curation.
- Built internal R scripts and contributed to pipeline automation for host–pathogen studies.

### Wellcome Sanger Institute & University of Cambridge — Doctoral Researcher  
*Cambridge, UK • 2020 – 2023*
- Developed workflows to analyse large biological datasets (genomes and metagenomes).
- Performed bioinformatic analyses of genomes and metagenomes.
- Gave invited and contributed talks to a variety of audiences.
- Provided guidance and training to students.

## Selected Projects
- **wf-pgx (ONT)**: Designed and now maintain flagship pharmaco-genomics workflow; uses automated container builds, regression suites, and robust documentation pipeline.
 - **Biopharma QC Workflows (team support)**: Contributed to workflows aimed toward regulatory compliance: `wf-vax-qc`, `wf-plasmid-qc`, and `wf-installation-qualification`.
- **Chromosome-scale Genome Annotation (MSc)**: Nextflow workflow to annotate multi‑megabase animal genomes; integrated gene prediction, repeat masking, and evidence-driven refinement for mid-scale HPC.
- **Assembly Completeness Assessment (PhD)**: Automated pipeline to assess completeness of newly assembled multi‑megabase animal genomes using orthology- and k‑mer–based metrics.
- **GEO Differential Expression Automation (BSc thesis)**: Automated microarray-based differential expression across dozens of GEO experiments using GNU Make; downloaded datasets and Brainarray annotations, inferred experimental designs, executed group-vs-group contrasts, and summarised results in a single table.
- **Regulatory Gene Visualisation (BSc training)**: Automated gene visualisation for a gene regulation website using PHP and available regulatory annotations.
- **AI-assisted Preference Matching (personal R&D)**: Prototyped LLM‑assisted workflows to match user preferences against free‑text (e.g., adverts) to reduce manual screening.

Context and outcomes (selected):
- wf‑pgx: assembled and evolved the `wf-pgx` research workflow from a barebones template to a usable pipeline.
- Biopharma QC: supported team delivery of QC workflows aligned with regulatory expectations; clearer installation/qualification steps.
- Verification Suite: standardised release checks and metrics diffs; faster validation cycles.
- AI matching: accelerated manual screening tasks using LLM‑assisted triage and ranking prototypes.
